# VickyMD 微记

> Please note that this project is released under **[AGPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/)**.

This WYSIWYG markdown editor is built and modified on top of [@laobubu](https://github.com/laobubu)'s awesome project [HyperMD](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD).

We will migrate to [codemirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/) in the future, which is going to be a complete rewrite.
But for now, we will just stick to the current [codemirror 5](https://codemirror.net) codebase, that is what HyperMD currently uses.

The documentation is on the way :)
