## Level 1

In this section, you will learn how to make HyperMD basically runs on your webpage.

- [**Quick Start**](./quick-start.md): first of all, let's put HyperMD into your webpage...
- [**PowerPacks**](./powerpacks.md): and integrate 3rd-party libs and services, make HyperMD more powerful!

Once a editor is ready, lots of API and methods are available. These pages can be helpful.

- [**CodeMirror's API**](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#api): remember that a HyperMD editor is also a CodeMirror editor!

## Level 2

In this section, you will try to add some interesting features to your editor.

Assuming there is a variable named as `editor`, storing your editor instance.

- **Load and Save Content**

  - `editor.getValue()` returns Markdown text string
  - `editor.setValue(text)`

- **Toggle WYSIWYG mode**

  - `HyperMD.switchToNormal(editor)`
  - `HyperMD.switchToHyperMD(editor)`

- **Update HyperMD Editor/Addon Options**

  - You can use `editor.setOption(name, value)` during runtime
  - HyperMD-related addon option names always start with "hmd",
    the full list can be found here: [Options-for-Addons][]

- **Handle Relative URL**
  - Image and Link URL in Markdown can be relative URL.
  - HyperMD editors have a API `editor.hmdResolveURL("../relative/url")`, which is provided by addon _ReadLink_.
  - _ReadLink_ the addon resolves relative paths, and its `baseURI` is configurable.
  - Before loading Markdown text, `editor.setOption('hmdReadLink', { baseURI: "xxx" })`
    where `xxx` is the absolute path to the directory. eg. `http://laobubu.net/notes/2018/6/` (without filename)

## Level 3

In this section, you will learn how HyperMD magic works, and write some advanced handlers.

1. A document (Markdown text) is loaded
2. **HyperMD Mode** parses, tokenizes and styles the text
3. **Addons** use the parsed info to implement features
   - **HideToken** hides `*`s, `~~`s and more formatting tokens
   - **Click** checks the clicked element's token type, and call ClickHandler
   - **FoldMath** checks if a token is the beginning of a formula (usually, a `$`), folds to the end and renders $\TeX$ formula
   - _and more_

**Conclusion**:

1. To support some syntax-based feature, eg. #hashtag , you have to
   - [Configure the Mode](./options-for-mode.md)
   - or [submit a feature request](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD/issues/new) if the syntax is not supported yet.
2. The parsed token info is essential and useful.
   - :bulb: **Hint**: You can use [CodeMirror mode-related API](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#api_mode) to extract the parsed info.
     - [getTokenAt](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#getTokenAt)
     - [getLineTokens](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#getLineTokens)
     - [getTokenTypeAt](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#getTokenTypeAt)
     - _and more_

## Level 4

In this section, you will learn how to write a HyperMD addon / powerpack.

**PowerPacks** are optional modules that integrate 3rd-party libs and services to HyperMD.
They work with specific addons and 3rd-party libs.

Here is a list of [HyperMD built-in PowerPacks](./powerpacks.md) and their source code can be found [here](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD/tree/master/src/powerpack).

## Level 5

Understand TypeScript and CodeMirror? Want to add new features to HyperMD core? Great! Let's dive into HyperMD.

[The source code of HyperMD](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD/) is open on GitHub! To develop, VSCode is highly recommended.
